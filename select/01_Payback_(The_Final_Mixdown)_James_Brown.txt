Hey, gotta gotta payback
(The big payback)
Revenge, I'm mad
(The big payback)
Got to get back, I need some get back
Payback, payback
(The big payback)
That's it, payback, revenge
I'm mad!

I get down with my girlfriend, that ain't right
Hollarin', cussin', you wanna fight
Payback is a thing you gotta see, hell
Brother do any damn thing to me

Sold me out, for chicken change
(Yes you did)
Told me that they, they had it all arranged
You had me down, and that's a fact
And now you punk, you gotta get ready

For the bigpayback
(The bigpayback)
That's where I am, you gotta big payback
(The big payback)

I can do wheelin', I can do dealin'
(Yes we can)
But I don't do no damn squealin'
I can dig rappin', I'm ready, I can dig scrappin'
But I can't dig that backstabbin'
(Oh no)

The brother get ready, that's a fact
Get ready you mother for the big payback
(The big payback)
Let me hit 'em, hit 'em, friend hit 'em, hey, hey

You took my money, you got my honey
Don't want me to see what you doing to me
I got to get back, I gotta deal with you, gotta deal with you
Gotta deal with ya, I gotta deal with ya, hey let me tell ya!

Get down with my woman, that ain't right
You hollarin' and cussin', you wanna fight
Don't do me no darn favor
I don't know karate, but I know ka-razor
(Yes we do)

Hey get ready, that's a fact
Get ready you mother for the big payback

Get ready for the big payback
(The big payback)
Hit me again
No don't

Get ready I need it, I need a hit again
The same one, the same one, same one, hit 'em back
(The big payback)

Sold me out for chicken change
Said my woman had it all arranged
Tryin' to make a deal, she wants to squeal
But I had my boys on her heels

Saw me comin', told a lie, she broke down and she wanted to cry
I don't care what she does, she'll be doin' just like she was
Take those kids and raise 'em up
Somebody teach 'em a rightous tough

Take her, take that woman, it's one place she found
Just run that mother out of town
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
Make her get up, make her get up, get out

I'm mad, I want revenge, I want revenge, my
(The big payback)
My patience ends, I want revenge
My patience ends, I want revenge
I want revenge, I want revenge
(The big payback)
Gonna get some hits, I need those hits
I need those hits, hit me!

Now I need those hits
Carry on, carry on, paper [Incomprehensible]
(The big payback)

Alright
(The big payback)
