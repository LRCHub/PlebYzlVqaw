Woah yeah
You know how much I love you
So you keep me guessing
You know I'm gonna wait
So you keep me waiting
One day I'll find a love that's true
And I won't be thinking 'bout you
Now tell me
(How) how would you like it
(How, how) would you like it
How would you like a little pay back
Ah-ha, of what you're dishing out
You found out I would plead
So you keep me pleading
You found out I would cry
So you keep me crying
One day you'll be crying too
And you can boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo
Till your face turns blue
Now tell me...

When you don't give a sigh
If your love do or die
It's easy for you to make it
But suppose the tables are turned on you
Pause a minute - think a minute
Tell me, could you take it.
