Out all night, till the break of dawn,
Once again you know you've done somebody wrong, yeah you did, babe,
And you know you're gonna get what's due,
One of these days it will all catch up to you

Chorus:
When it comes, its the big payback,
Don't you know its the big payback
Broken hearts, you know you've made quite a few, yeah you did, babe,
Runnin' around is all you want to do,
Livin' fast, you say you never gonna stop runnin',
One of these days, Mama, you'll get whats comin'

Chorus:
When it comes, its the big payback,
Don't you know its the big payback
Time will come for the big payback,
Don't you know, its the big payback,
I tell you time's gonna come for the big payback,
Don't you know its the big payback

Big payback,
Big back,
Big payback,
Big payback
