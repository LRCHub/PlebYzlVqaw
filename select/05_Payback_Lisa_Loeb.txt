Is this how it ends
Lying in bed, talking to a cheap tape recorder
Instead of my friends
In bed with a low grade fever
They wanted to know, how could I leave you
I can't tell them that
It might sound like revenge
But some things don't need a payback
Some things are sure, some things you can feel safe about

Is this how it starts
I was waiting for my head to clear up
I thought I was smart, I'd find the answers in time
But the answers I find aren't what you want to hear
They're not even close

But some things don't need a payback
Some things are sure, some things you can feel safe about
Some things don't need a clear up

I remember good things, like the van breaking down
I sat on your lap in the auto repair
And you touched my hair
While the heavy drops rain on the pavement outside

Don't take revenge
Just let it lie
The easiest thing is if you just let it die
Don't give me a chance
You don't owe me that
Don't follow me out
Unless you're coming for some payback

But some things don't need a payback
Some things are sure, some things you can feel safe about
Some things don't need a clear up

Why did I leave
How long did it take
It could take forever

But some things don't need a payback
You got that?
